# Project 3

Author: Jeff Quittman Project: P#3 - Password Generator Date: April 2020

## Description:

Third project for the UCLA/Trilogy Full Stack Boot Camp that tasks the student with building a random password generator using Javascript. The password generator inputs are received through prompts
and confirm pop-ups and the user has to select the length of the password and between four formatting options to include in their password. The inputs are saved and used at the end to run a loop that
loops through a new array composed of the merged arrays from the formatting options and uses the length submitted as the character length. Input validation is set up to ensure that the user submites
the correct parameters for the password.
